00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.970
- In the last video,

2
00:00:00.970 --> 00:00:02.660
I talked all about the window object

3
00:00:02.660 --> 00:00:04.680
and how you can pretty much
just ignore it completely.

4
00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:05.520
And in this video,

5
00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:07.220
we wanna talk about the document object,

6
00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:10.060
which is incredibly useful
all across programming

7
00:00:10.060 --> 00:00:11.230
in the browser.

8
00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:13.313
So to see exactly what
this document object is,

9
00:00:13.313 --> 00:00:16.017
let's just console.log out document,

10
00:00:16.017 --> 00:00:17.820
and we just type in document.

11
00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:20.824
This is exactly the same as
if we typed window.document.

12
00:00:20.824 --> 00:00:23.950
They're both the same thing we
can just use document though,

13
00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:26.510
or window.document it's going
to print the same thing.

14
00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:27.343
As you can see,

15
00:00:27.343 --> 00:00:29.298
it prints out this weird
like hashtag document.

16
00:00:29.298 --> 00:00:30.311
And when we open this up,
